Read both the train and test datasets and merge them into x(measurements), y(activity) and subject.
Load the data(x's) feature, activity info and extract columns named 'mean'(-mean) and 'standard'(-std). 
Also, modify column names to descriptive. (-mean to Mean, -std to Std, and remove symbols like -, (, ))
Extract data by selected columns(from step 3), and merge x, y(activity) and subject data. 
Generate tidy.txt that consists of the mean of each variable for each subject and each activity.
